A fun classifier I made with fastai, hosted on AWS, and is live for testing.

Still no jupyter-notebook, code, and doc to show. 
You can mess around with the classifier though http://52.31.6.66/ :). 

Disclaimer: this classifier is by no means perfect, and I worked on it as long as I enjoyed doing so.
